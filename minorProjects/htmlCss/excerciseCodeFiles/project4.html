        <h1>About Tigers</h1>
        <p>The tiger is a large carnivorous mammal. In the wild it lives in the deep forest. The tiger feeds on animals that also live in the forests. The tiger can also be seen in a zoo within an enclosure. The habitat of the wild is re-created in the zoo for the tiger. The tigers in a zoo are fed and looked after. Tigers also mate and raise their cubs in a zoo. As the tiger is a critically endangered animal, captive breeding of the species helps in raising the animal’s population. There are many different sub-species of the tiger such as the Siberian tiger, the Sumatran tiger and the royal Bengal tiger. In India it is the royal Bengal tiger that is found. The royal Bengal tiger has a beautiful orange coat with black stripes. The stripe pattern in each individual tiger is different. This helps in conducting tiger census in a forest as each tiger has a unique stripe pattern. The white tiger that is also seen in India is not a sub-species of the tiger, but is so coloured due to a particular genetic condition. Forests are protected habitats of wild animals. They are known as national parks. Some of the dense forests where tigers are found are specially designated as tiger reserves, and are given special protection. The tiger is India’s national animal. It is a protected wild animal, and is listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act that includes critically endangered wild animals.</p>
